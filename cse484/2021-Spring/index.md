## Learning Objectives

In this course, students will study a variety of attacks on computer software
and hardware. These attacks are caused by the vulnerabilities in the design and
implementation of computer systems. The course emphasizes "learning by doing",
and requires students to conduct a series of lab exercises. Through these labs,
students can enhance their understanding of the principles, and be able to
apply those principles to solve real problems.


## Lab Sessions 

The TA will hold two lab sessions (identical) each week, 
we strongly recommend you to attend one of them. 
The goal of the lab session is to help you work 
on the labs.

## For Online Students

If you take this class from online, and you are in a timezone where the
class time falls between the midnight and 8:00am your local time,
you are allowed to watch the lecture videos, instead of attending
the class in real time. However, to provide students with
an experience similar to those attending the class in real time,
we will do the following:

 - Students will need to watch the lecture videos during the
   instructor's office hours. Consider this as the
   class time, and students should pay a full attention to the lecture video.
   Attendance will be taken.

 - The instructor will be online during this class time,
   and can be reached via Zoom and Slack. Students can interact with
   the instructor using Zoom or Slack.

 - The instructor may also ask students questions via Slack, and students are
   required to answer them promptly. A dedicated Slack channel is created
   for this purpose.
