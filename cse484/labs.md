## Notes

 - Working individually or in group: All labs are individual labs. You are 
   encouraged to discuss with others, but each student must independently
   carry out the tasks in the labs. You cannot copy code from other students.
   Any violation will be punished and reported to the university authority.

 - Lab Report: For all labs, You should submit a hardcopy of your lab report
 before the class on the due day. We may ask (randomly) selected students to
 give a demonstration.
