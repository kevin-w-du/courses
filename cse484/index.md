## Learning Objectives

In this course, students will study a variety of attacks on computer software
and hardware. These attacks are caused by the vulnerabilities in the design and
implementation of computer systems. The course emphasizes "learning by doing",
and requires students to conduct a series of lab exercises. Through these labs,
students can enhance their understanding of the principles, and be able to
apply those principles to solve real problems.


## Lab Sessions 

The TA will hold two lab sessions (identical) each week, 
we strongly recommend you to attend one of them. 
The goal of the lab session is to help you work 
on the labs.
