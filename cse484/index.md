## Learning Objectives

In this course, students will study a variety of attacks on computer software
and hardware. These attacks are caused by the vulnerabilities in the design and
implementation of computer systems. The course emphasizes "learning by doing",
and requires students to conduct a series of lab exercises. Through these labs,
students can enhance their understanding of the principles, and be able to
apply those principles to solve real problems.


## Lab Sessions 

You are required to attend the mandatory lab session each week. These lab
sessions are mandatory. You can only be excused if you have finished the
corresponding lab or your attendance is waived by the professor or TA.
