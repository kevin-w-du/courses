## Learning Objectives

This course provides an in-depth study of various network attacks techniques
and methods to defend against them. A number of threats and vulnerabilities of
the Internet will be covered, including various vulnerabilities of TCP/IP
protocols, denial of service (DOS), attacks on BGP, attacks on DNS servers,
and so on. This course will also cover defense mechanisms,
including firewalls, VPN, and cryptography.
The basics of the TCP/IP protocols will also be covered in the course.

The course emphasizes "learning by doing",
and requires students to conduct a series of lab exercises. Through these labs,
students can enhance their understanding of the principles, and be able to
apply those principles to solve real problems.
