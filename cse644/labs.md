## Lab Environment

We will use the SEED labs 2.0 for this class. Please follow the instructions
on the [SEED website](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labsetup.html) to install
the lab environment. Note: we will use Ubuntu 20.04 VM.

## Labs

Students should submit a lab report for each lab. 
For some labs, a short quiz (20 minutes) will be given on the due day. 
If a quiz is taken, students should submit the quiz and lab report
at the same time (both in hard-copy).
The grading will be based on both report and quiz (with
the quiz being the primary and the report being the secondary). 
The quiz is open book, but access to computers or any type of 
electronic devices is not allowed. The quiz will be based on the labs, 
so if you don't spend enough time on the lab, you will be unlikely 
to get a good grade on the quiz.

## Notes

 - Working individually or in group: All labs are individual labs. You are 
   encouraged to discuss with others, but each student must independently
   carry out the tasks in the labs. You cannot copy code from other students.
   Any violation will be punished and reported to the university authority.

 - Lab Report: The deadline for the submission is at 12:30pm on the due day (i.e.,
   before the class start). If a quiz is taken, the report should be 
   submitted at the end of the quiz. 
   We may ask selected students to give a demonstration.
