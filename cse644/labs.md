## Lab Environment

We will use the SEED labs 2.0 for this class. Please follow the instructions
on the [SEED website](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labsetup.html) to install
the lab environment. Note: we will use Ubuntu 20.04 VM.

## Labs

The grading for each lab will be based either on the lab report or on the quiz.
If quiz is used, you do not need to submit the 
report for that lab. The quizzes will be based on the labs, so if you don't 
spend enough time on the lab, you will be unlikely to get a good grade on
the quiz.

## Notes

 - Working individually or in group: All labs are individual labs. You are 
   encouraged to discuss with others, but each student must independently
   carry out the tasks in the labs. You cannot copy code from other students.
   Any violation will be punished and reported to the university authority.

 - Lab Report: For all labs, You should submit a hardcopy of your lab report
   before the class on the due day. We may ask (randomly) selected students to
   give a demonstration.
