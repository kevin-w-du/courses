## Learning Objectives

In this course, students will study a variety of attacks on computer software and hardware. These attacks are caused by the vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of computer systems. The course emphasizes "learning by doing", and requires students to conduct a series of lab exercises. Through these labs, students can enhance their understanding of the principles, and be able to apply those principles to solve real problems. After completion of the course, students should be able to possess the following skills:

 - be able to analyze and evaluate software systems for its security properties,
 - be able to evaluate risks faced by computer systems,
 - be able to explain how various attacks work,
 - be able to detect common vulnerabilities in software,
 - be able to design and implement basic security mechanisms to protect computer systems,
 - be able to describe and generalize various software vulnerabilities,
 - be able to compare various security mechanisms, and articulate their advantages and limitations,
 - be able to apply security principles to solve problems.
