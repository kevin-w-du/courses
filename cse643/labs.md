on the [SEED website](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labsetup.html) to install
the lab environment. Note: we will use Ubuntu 20.04 VM.

## Notes

 - Final Project: students who are not able to do the final project due to the lack
   of the programming background can choose to move the weight of this project
   to the final exam, but only 10 points (out of 15) will be moved, and the other 
   5 points will be lost. You don't need to tell me about your decision until
   the deadline of the project, as I want to encourage you to work on the project,
   instead of taking the penalty.

 - Working individually or in group: All labs are individual labs. You are 
   encouraged to discuss with others, but each student must independently
   carry out the tasks in the labs. You cannot copy code from other students.
   Any violation will be punished and reported to the university authority.

 - Lab Report: For all labs, You should submit a hardcopy of your lab report
   before the class on the due day. We may ask (randomly) selected students to
   give a demonstration.
