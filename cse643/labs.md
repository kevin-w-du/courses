## Notes

 - Working individually or in group: All labs are individual labs. You are 
   encouraged to discuss with others, but each student must independently
   carry out the tasks in the labs. You cannot copy code from other students.
   Any violation will be punished and reported to the university authority.

 - Lab Report: You should submit a hardcopy of your lab report
   on the due day, right after the quiz. The lab report will be checked only 
   for the completeness, not for grading purpose. Your lab grade will be decided 
   only by the quiz given on the due day. However, if your lab report is incomplete,
   corresponding portions of grade will be deducted.
